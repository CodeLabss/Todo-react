The todo-context folder is designed to manage the state and behavior of the Todo application using React's Context API. It encapsulates the logic for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving todo items, enabling a centralized state management solution that promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

Key features include:

Context Provider: A context provider component that wraps the application, allowing any child component to access the todo state and actions.

State Management: Utilizes React's state management hooks to handle todo items efficiently.

Custom Hooks: Provides custom hooks for easier access to todo-related functionalities, enhancing code reusability.

Reducer Logic: Implements reducer functions to manage complex state transitions related to todos.

This structure helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns, making the application scalable and easier to debug.
